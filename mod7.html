<p>
MagicaVoxel is a very easy tool to use, to create and animate 3-D characters. However these characters created in MagicaVoxel will always turn out blocky. To animate the characters you make Mixamo is a great tool to animate 3-D characters.(provided you don't acidentally have extra voxels/pixels not connected to the character.) Which is what caused the error in my first character.
